As my friends can confirm, I deal with a TON of problems that aren't public facing and while its defo rough to see people ""doing well"" and such, don't take it personally. Most likely, that person is dealing with other shit no one can see. To second @caprice 's point, college throws A TON of shit at you. Whats up to you is to define what you see as ""success"". I've loosely defined success to be learning something, anything. Doesn't matter if its as ""small"" as ""i learned i can't run"" or as ""big"" as ""i learned how to make a web app"" ‚Äî it still counts towards life and you still progress","","üëç (1)"
"117543813563547648","LittlestAnt#3124","2019-10-10 01:05:17Z","@queenofthekyriarchy As some one who‚Äôs been a part of many other organizations, I have reviewed applications for many projects programs. Let me say that it‚Äôs very randomized and often based on a first come first serve basis. Also, orgs don‚Äôt tell you about how many people they accept and for the sake of those orgs‚Äô privacy I‚Äôm not going to reveal the exact statistics or who those orgs are. But let me just say acceptance rates are LOW. Like lower than UC college acceptance low. When the stats are like that, you aren‚Äôt a failure, you were just unlucky this time around.

Secondly, you don‚Äôt need to rely on student organizations in order to build projects. Almost all of the projects that have been a part of my resume over the years are built during hackathons or on my own, rather than through student organization programs. Go look for open source projects to contribute to! Or go follow a youtube tutorial! The great thing about computing is you don‚Äôt need ANY money, unlike other forms of engineering. All you really need is time and a computer.","",""
"117543813563547648","LittlestAnt#3124","2019-10-10 01:05:24Z","Also, you are NOT a failure. Even if you‚Äôre at home not really doing much, you are NOT a failure. A lot of people don‚Äôt know this about me but I spent the entirety of my first year playing league of legends 10+ hours a day. I didn‚Äôt know what an internship was until my second year and I didn‚Äôt even have a resume until then as well. Zero projects. The fact that you‚Äôre already thinking about doing projects or going beyond class means you‚Äôre ahead of me. Life worked out in the end for me so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll definitely work out for you.

Finally, let me say that Ronak and Casey are right when they say college throws a ton of shit at you. This is my fourth year at UCSD and trust me when I say I‚Äôve had some major low moments. Not quite being rejected from student orgs but similar - there was an 8 month period last year when I had nonstop rejections despite nearly 200 applications to companies. It worked out for me in the end. Your luck always turns around at some point as long as you remain positive and continue to try your best. Not everything is in your control but having a positive attitude is. I always tell people college is going to be both the worst AND best years of your life but it‚Äôs that rollercoaster of emotions that makes it so much fun and so memorable. You‚Äôll make it through this, just keep pushing on and if orgs (or internships in the future) reject you, keep seeking more opportunities.","",""

Also as just some generic pieces of advice for everyone:
Don't hesitate to ask others for help or to put yourself out there, i'm willing to bet that everyone here has dealt with impostor syndrome at some point time, and many of us will probably still continue to deal with it
Another thing, while extremely difficult, try to not let yourself get too down by failure. i'm not saying that you shouldn't feel down at all, but learning to pick yourself back up after falling walk differently from then on is unfortunately necessary, like forget internships, i've been repeatedly rejected by every single dance team i've auditioned for - i can't even do decent on my hobbies lmao. but as everyone here as already said, college and life in general will inevitably throw some rough shit at you, and learning how to pick yourself up and how to reflect and then move forward is probably the most fundamental bases of progress there is. To quote ray dalio, ‚ÄúDive into the markets, have the shit kicked out of you, and learn how to do things differently"".
And lastly, I'm gonna take another page from Ray Dalio and say ""Party like crazy and don‚Äôt make the grades your highest priority. Make the friendships and your experiences most important"". college is what you make of it, so make it memorable and make it fun üòÉ

"117543813563547648","LittlestAnt#3124","2020-05-24 18:35:55Z","Alex, in my article, I criticize student orgs multiple times for specific reasons. It seems you‚Äôre already planning events (a hackathon) and you‚Äôre already asking me about protocol.

I have been involved in so many orgs in my time at UCSD (I‚Äôve been on leadership in 6 of them now; involved with many more). The reason why I formed my own is because in the realm of tech, I felt that so many orgs missed the point. I‚Äôm afraid you also completely missed the point of my article, and I recommend you reread the article again as I **already** gave all the secrets to ACM away.

Student orgs are nothing more than groups of people. In essence, that‚Äôs all any organization is. ACM is successful because we didn‚Äôt focus on the tech in tech org. We focused on the org part. We didn‚Äôt start planning our events or think about protocol for months.

We did something completely different from the majority of orgs on campus. We spent months developing our mission, values, and goals hoping it would yield a vibrant and welcoming culture. We spent months recruiting the right kind of people in our organization.

At the end of the day, the foundation of any good organization is built off people and culture. I‚Äôve talked to CEOs who will often tell you the same. You can have a plan to host a big hackathon and set up protocols, but if you do it all by yourself, it‚Äôll be completely impossible. If you get started on planning those without a team of people, and add people later on, they are not going to feel an attachment to your org, nor will they feel like their ideas mattered to you to begin with.

At this stage with your student org, if you‚Äôre asking me about anything but people or culture, I‚Äôm afraid you need to go back to the drawing board. In my article, I always said **WE** built ACM rather than **I** built ACM. ACM would not have been possible if I didn‚Äôt have amazing people by my side and if we didn‚Äôt continue to bring in more and more amazing people.","","care (21),‚ù§Ô∏è (12),acm (11),acm_white (11)"

start by reflecting on what you have already done. did you do your best? why or why not? if you did your best, then you already accomplished something. you're right that sometimes, no one else is in your shoes, but you're not in any else's either. if you did your best at the time, what more can you do?

that pressure and certain situations can be extremely difficult sometimes, but you make the most of the cards you've been dealt. if you fall to it too, then you can't expect yourself to be better. so in that case, strive to be better by just continuing to do your best and take pride in yourself","","care (9),ü•∫ (3),owo (2)"

you don't have to be alone, but you can't expect someone to do things for you either. your satisfaction should not be something that relies on someone else, but yourself. it's perfectly fine to have a mentor, and perfectly fine to not have one. a mentor would be there to support and guide, but not plan your life for you. it won't solve all your problems because that's something that you have to work towards yourself too","","üò¢ (2)"
