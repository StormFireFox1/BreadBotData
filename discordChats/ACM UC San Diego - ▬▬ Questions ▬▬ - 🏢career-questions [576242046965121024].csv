I didn't even know that people did internships until I was a second year. I spent my entire first year playing league for 10+ hours a day (went from silver to diamond btw add me LittlestAnt) and running a ton of miles and making a lot of friends. ENJOY your first year and don't freak out too much about internships. You have so many years in college to figure it out. You only go through college once so don't spend every bit of your time being career focused.

For those of you who are still dead set on getting an internship, know that there's plenty of time. I got my first internship offer at the end of my second year and the final round interview took place AFTER summer had already started. Realize that while it is largely a numbers game (I applied to hundreds before I got my big internship last year), there's more to it than just that. There's always ways to improve your resume and elevator pitch. I make it a habit to make changes to my resume once a month. I'll also likely be bringing back the UCSD Student's Guide to Talking to Each Other workshop either this quarter or next quarter to help you all with speaking / networking.","","acm (1)"

The different components of STAR are:

Situation ‚Äì During interviews, the interviewer will ask you to describe a challenging situation that you have encountered in the past.

Task ‚Äì The interviewer will want to know what goal you were trying to achieve to overcome that challenge.

Action ‚Äì Here, the interviewer wants to learn about the steps you took to meet that goal, and why.

Results ‚Äì Finally, you will be asked to describe the outcome. Were your actions successful in helping you to obtain your goal and overcome the challenge? What lessons did you take away from the experience?

While the STAR method has been primarily used by interviewers, it is easy to see how it can be adapted as a guide to resume-writing.

so like answer the following questions on a google doc
tell me about your past experience
what is your greatest failure
tell me about a time you worked on a team
etc

NOW do not memorize it. Your interview will seem artificial and inauthentic if you are just reciting scripted answers. Use the google doc so youre brainstorming ahead of time but your actual interview should be as genuine and follow the flow of the convo as much as possible

Not me personally, but a mentee of mine landed an offer this way. I've heard stories of friends of friends who did too.

> I‚Äôm also not having too much luck applying online (applied to around 100 companies so far and only heard back from 2).
On the assumption this is your first internship, 100 companies is actually a relatively low number. If you're just applying online directly for your first internship, you want to aim for probably least 300 companies. Personally, back when I was applying for my first internship I sent out 450+ applications. (It gets better though! I barely sent out 10 last year). 

iirc you also mentioned you're a freshman, and this will drastically reduce your chances of getting an internship on top of not having (assuming) any previous experience. Most, as in like 99% of freshmen, do not land an internship. Heck, most sophomores and even many juniors don't. Increase your chances with referrals instead.

> Also, would it be okay to apply to positions that are over a month old as long as they‚Äôre still accepting applications?
Absolutely, worst case you just get rejected, no harm done.","",""

@AlexL1220 My $.02 then: I would probably base it on primarily the fact you're a freshman, so you're just simply not the hiring target. Being a little more blunt, having a previous internship at the NOAA is good, but it simply may just not be well recognized by many of the companies you're applying to (and this could apply to anything on anyone's resume). This also does apply to CS Research experience - it's great you have it, but it's probably not what the companies are looking for, which lowers/nullifies its inherent value.","",""

@YoItzTiff For the year I did 450+ applications (sophomore year, no previous exp, just projects), I got 8 interviews, including interviews at Microsoft and Google. The year after (once I did have experience), I applied to 12 companies and got 12 interviews lol.

> has anyone ever gotten an interview after applying to a position ur completely unqualified for?
Yes. This is a common occurrence.

> idk i feel like mass applying everywhere doesnt really make a difference since the only companies that will reply are those who were inclined to take freshmen to begin with
The counterargument is that's why you mass apply, because you really don't know which companies were inclined to begin with. You're only increasing your chances the more you apply. Spam applying does work and it's a common tactic, but like always, try to get a referral from someone you know.","",""

"117543813563547648","LittlestAnt#3124","2020-04-02 21:16:34Z","First off, some advice on having versus not having an internship since y'all are stressed out:

1. You DO NOT need an internship your first year. I didn't even start building my career until my second year (no resume, no projects, etc) and it didn't stop me from being able to interview with Big Ns and unicorns a year later.
2. If you are unable to get an internship, don't freak out too much. Projects are extremely valuable. At least for my resume, each of my projects takes up as much room as each of my internships. I've noticed recruiters / interviewers ask about each equally. Yes, of course work experience far outweighs project experience but project experience alone should be able to get you your foot in the door. You won't be able to rush straight into work experience if you don't have project experience on your resume yet.
3. One, two, three rejections are nothing. I know, the feeling of rejection sucks. But just because one single company rejects you doesn't mean you should let it get to you. I've been rejected from dozens of companies. Even after I had a Big N on my resume, I was still getting rejected from small, relatively unknown companies. You need to get used to it. Learn from each rejection, and accept the fact that this process is not going to require one or two rejections - expect dozens, if not hundreds. Trust me, my rejection count is definitely pretty high up there, as well as many other upperclassmen in our org. A lot of us have been able to secure some pretty stellar internships, but that was after months and months of repeated applications and rejections.","",""
"117543813563547648","LittlestAnt#3124","2020-04-02 21:28:23Z","Now, on how to get an internship especially given the COVID-19 situation

1. So it seems like right now, a lot of you have been going to all of the recruiting websites and mass sending out applications. This is fine, the process is definitely a grind and this will be one of the things you need to do when starting off for sure. However, don't think too much into each job's requirements. Whether you're qualified or not, you won't know unless you submit the application. Just because a company puts less qualificatons doesn't mean they expect less and just because a company puts more qualifications doesn't mean they expect more. At the end of the day, they're just going to take the top candidates of everyone who applies.

2. Realize that online applications are terribly ineffective. You shouldn't expect to hear back unless you play the huge ass numbers game. This should be your last resort when applying to companies. For better options: 
- Leverage your network for referrals
- Cold email recruiters
- Go to online career fairs (There's actually a bunch rn that no one's talking about)

IF YOU DO ANY OF THE ABOVE OPTIONS, make sure you do them respectfully. Don't randomly message every person you know and have fake conversations that lead up to your request for a referral. Same goes with recruiters. Be clear with what you want and why you're qualified off the get go and don't be pushy if they say no.","",""
"117543813563547648","LittlestAnt#3124","2020-04-02 21:28:26Z","3. Record every single internship you apply to on a spreadsheet. Keep track of your data so you know how effective each result is. Write notes as to the approach you took to contact that company and see what gets you interviews and what doesn't. This data will be helpful for the next few steps.

4. If you're not getting responses, change your approach. Get your resume reviewed, I'll be more available in #üî•resume-roast now that I'm quarantined at home and also get your cover letters reviewed. I honestly stopped applying with cover letters because I don't find them effective enough, but if you're desperate, make each application as fleshed out as you can.

5. Make sure you practice mock interviews and interview questions during this entire time period. When you finally get that interview, only then does the process really begin. You're going to find yourself overwhelmed if you start later rather than sooner so practice ASAP.","","‚ù§Ô∏è (14)"

"65559042231119872","Snu#0167","2020-04-10 01:33:30Z","I think my strategy from Fall quarter to Winter quarter was pretty different and found it way more effective. I applied to 120+ companies in the Fall quarter through online applications and got 0 responses. I think it's partly because my resume wasn't as good as Winter quarter's, but mostly because online applications are just total crapshoots. I've applied online to companies, gotten rejected, then gotten an interview through the same company at the career fair. I belive they do this because a large part of the career fair is a small behavioral interview that can get your foot in the door. For Winter quarter, I'm pretty sure I applied to only ~50-80 companies online and did most of my work at career fairs and info sessions. Near the end of Winter quarter, I started running out of interview requests and emailed a few companies. I personalized one pretty heavily for the company and that's the one out of the five emails that led to an offer. 

I won't say that online applications don't work because as I overhauled two resumes during Winter quarter for PM/SWE positions that aligned way more with my skillset, I got a dramatically higher success rate for online applications. If you're going to end up with the strategy of ""mass"" cold emailing, you should apply online first before. Recruiters probably wake up to dozens of emails of formulaic emails, and if you haven't applied online, it's going to be more work on their part. I dont have enough of a sample size to say whether or not personalized cold emails emails is better than mass cold emailing with a template, but small personalized emails worked for me. I will note that I sent personalized emails for people in SWE and PM positions rather than recruiters though.","",""

- In Fall I applied to 126 companies online and got 0 interviews from online apps. Interview sources: 1 from career fair, 1 from info session

I know you must get this all the time, but my name is Ronak and I'm a student at UC San Diego. I came across Wistly and really resonated with your mission to ship @Snu .

Not having an internship your first year summer is not the end of the world. The vast majority of first years do not have internships. As nice as an internship will be, I think the best thing you can do your first year is to have fun and enjoy yourself. You have several decades to build your career but you only have a few years to enjoy college.

There's still a lot you can do to make sure you're all set on your career. My resume, to date, contains more information about my projects than it does about my internships. Besides that, DO use your networks to your advantage, but DON'T bother people too much. There's a fine line that you're at risk of crossing when you're talking with recruiters / employees / connections that you aren't close with. Still, reach out them but make sure that when you do so, come off as nicely and respectfully as possible.

I'd honestly prefer that this channel not be a constant place for people to freak out about not having an internship. I love to answer questions and give advice, but there's a lot of pessimism in this channel and a lot of the approaches / questions / answers give off a tone that it's over. Chill a bit - things will be fine especially if you're in your first year. I'm dead serious when I say I not only didn't have an internship my first year, I didn't even know what an internship was, I had NO projects, NO experience, and I had NO resume (literally no document made). Still made it to a good company, but I did so not only by grinding, but by doing so smartly and respectfully as well. Please, I ask just don't spam this channel with your anxiety - save that for #üí®vent.","","care (13),üëç (5)"

"117543813563547648","LittlestAnt#3124","2020-05-15 08:58:35Z","@AlexL1220 Long post aside, if you want to know what I did in order to get a big internship - I found good mentors, practiced elevator pitches on repeat, built a ton of projects, grew my network, and did a lot of the advice that is always given on this channel. The process works, but you need to be not only persistent about it, but be positive so it doesn't bring you down.

I'd argue my strongest asset was that I was optimistic throughout the whole time. No matter how much I struggled, I came into each career fair and interview with a lot of energy. When I talked to people, I didn't give off the impression that I was anxious about failing to get an internship, but that I was excited about the chance of succeeding at getting an internship. Keep in mind, I failed a lot. Had dozens of rejections myself, and over a hundred companies ghosting me. My first internship at a small company took 6 months to get. My second internship took me from 7 months. It's a grind and you have to accept it.

Also, realize that personality matters a lot to recruiters. Build your tech and professional development skills on the side, but everyone can develop those. If you want to stand out, be yourself. Don't just act like straight A student who just knows how to code and give a perfect elevator pitch - a million students out there can do that. Throw YOUR personality into the mix and tie it all together. My best elevator pitches were ones where I talked about marathon running to emphasize what a hard worker I am. My most successful networking experiences were when I shifted the convo from engineering to anime (turns out some world famous researchers are weebs too?). My best interviews were ones where I talked about personal LIFE experiences and I made jokes that made interviewers laugh.

Alex, I‚Äôm not sure if I can give much practical advice in terms of constructing an elevator pitch or whether or not reaching out to recruiters is effective. However, I think it‚Äôs important to take note of the current situation. Plenty of hard-working and competent students have had their internships cancelled/changed because of everything that‚Äôs been going on. There‚Äôs probably very few companies out there that are actively hiring new interns, and even if they were, they‚Äôd probably be looking for people with more experience. Maybe some of those driven people who had their internships cancelled may be applying to the very same internships you‚Äôve been applying to.

Now, I‚Äôm not saying this to be negative by any means. I‚Äôm just saying that... right now isn‚Äôt the best time to be pining over an internship. You shouldn‚Äôt be discouraged if you don‚Äôt get an internship this summer, or fall, winter, or whatever. You‚Äôre a freshman, you still have plenty of time. I mean, look at at Emily, for example. There‚Äôs plenty of others here who have had a similar freshman year, and look at them now. Although I think asking for advice on interviews, elevator pitches, applications, etc is a productive use of time, perhaps improving other things may be more productive?

Emily said herself not to ‚Äúact like a straight A student who just knows how to code and give a perfect elevator pitch.‚Äù Maybe relax a tad the next few months. It‚Äôs not great to be stressed - discouraged, even - over something that most students won‚Äôt have until past their junior year. Pick up some new hobbies! Develop yourself as a person. If it‚Äôs hard to think of specific life experiences for your elevator pitch, create some.","","ü•∫ (7),üëâ (5),üëà (5)"
