üìù I made a ""How to make a resume"" workshop video. You can look at the timestamps but it gives tips and examples of what you can do to create a resume coming from different background (from incoming first year up to full-time engineer). It's kind of long but hopefully you learn something. Thanks!

First of all, Professor Guo at UCSD wrote a big, blunt FAQ about grad admissions and how-to's here: <http://www.pgbovine.net/grad-school-app-tips.htm>

Second, here is r/GradAdmissions wiki links: <http://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/wiki/index?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf> 

If you haven't seen these before, this should be enough to point you in the right direction. Additionally, there are suggested subs like r/AskAcademia, r/GradSchool, and of course getting the courage to talk to your professors (TA's might be easier to talk to if you're scared like me)","","care (3)"
