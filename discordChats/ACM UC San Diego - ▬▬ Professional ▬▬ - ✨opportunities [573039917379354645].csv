Linaro is hosting a conference in San Diego on September 25th. about making a career out of Open Source.  There will also be a take home hackathon where you will be given a Dragonboard and hardware.Tickets are normally $750, however Robert Wolff, 96 Boards community manager and UCSD alumni, wants to get UCSD students in for free. By registering with the link below, you can get free admission. I'll also be organizing carpool rides later on for anyone who plans on attending. If you signed up, please react to this post with a üëç so I can keep track. Registration is capped to 50 UCSD students total.

**Sign-up link:** https://www.96boards.org/go/san19-community/

So I just talked to David Ding and the conference is sending out confirmation emails on Tuesday. In the meantime, if you're going to the conference and need a ride, please fill out this form. Also, fill out the form even if you're not in the list of names (I only tagged the people who reacted to the post up above). Thank you!

**ALSO, attendance for the conference is still open.** The reason why confirmation emails are coming out later are because they're still advertising for it. View the pinned messages for this channel to find the original post (The thumb tack on the top right)

I find this insanely helpful and way better than practicing DS /ALGO on your own so you can adapt to that interview setting.
