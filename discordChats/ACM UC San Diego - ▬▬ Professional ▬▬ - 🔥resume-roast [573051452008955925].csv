1. Shorten it to 1 page. This was really surprising to me cause normally the problem with first years is that you all can't reach 1 page in length. 4 pages of experience is impressive! But definitely shorten it to one page. Recruiters want you to be concise and only focus on the best experiences .The general rule is 1 page per 10 years of experience.

2.  As for things to remove - Remove descriptions of each of the places. Remove the paragraphs talking about what you learned. Put those in bullet points and really target your achievements.

3. Remove references. CS companies almost never want them.","",""

You don't need your address/city.
Linkedin url seems a little weird under your name on its own. Keep it along with your other contact info.
Use bullet points instead of paragraphs. Try to keep them about a line each.
Your right column seems pretty cramped. Consider doing a single column.
Work Experience should be above projects because getting paid to do work looks better.
For your projects you have . a '-' so you can have a your role after it, but for Quad and E4E, it's just blank after the '-'.

First off, keep your resume down to one page. I think the highlights section is not necessary (recruiters don't care for it). Also try to shorten your description for your internship to just a few lines (At least trim it in half but I would recommend removing at least 2/3).

I would make some of your lines shorter as well. Try to keep everything in concise bullet points. Remember that recruiters go through thousands of resumes a day. Your goal is to make every single word on your resume meaningful so even when recruiters are skimming through it, they'll feel that you're a good candidate.

Additionally, I would increase the font size. Again, your goal is to make your resume easy to read for a recruiter who has gone through thousands of these and whose eyes are probably burning up by the time they get to yours.

I personally recommend the order experience / education --> projects --> awards --> skills. I think recruiters care most about experience and check for skills last.

Everything else is great. You have a tremendous amount of experience and this is a very strong resume for a first year. As you progress through college, shift out some of your high school experience with college experience.

Also, I would recommend bringing your resume to the career fair on October 2nd. I recommend asking recruiters to critique your resume. We're also hosting a resume workshop the Monday before (September 30).","",""

I love your resume design, I've seen the template a lot amongst graphic designers. Unfortunately, while it looks nice, software engineering recruiters want a lot more information. I would expand on the descriptions of each of your top experiences. At the very least, go more into detail about your experience at Wolfram.

It's also recommended to format your descriptions in the form of bullet points (It's ugly having dots all over your resume, I know) in order to help recruiters get through your resume faster. They're spending just a few seconds on your resume and so it's important to make it as readable as possible, even if it sacrifices some of the aesthetic.

I also highly recommend having a single column format resume in order to pass Applicant Tracking Software. Feel free to bring fancy looking resumes to career fairs and recruiting events next week though","",""

I see your point about more info. I'll definitely add more info about my internship and some of the OSS projects.

idk how I feel about the design changes, I'll try to mess around with it tonight. I'm not really applying to Big N companies anytime soon, and I feel I'd rather just use something pretty/unique.

For example, @Daniel Truong was an EP(What is now STEP) intern at Google this past summer and I was a SWE intern and our work was pretty similar.

But in terms of the look, I would actually fix your left column so that there's more space in the middle between the left and right side? To me it feels too cluttered so fixing the margins would definitely help! I'd also advise you to take out the high school coursework in your resume since I feel that you already have a lot of relevant experience that having the high school courses wouldn't rly help. But for now keeping the high school leadership is solid. Also, I wouldn't even put ""First-Year Plan"". If you just list the courses it'll be fine.","","‚úä (1)"
"574753989069897729","Daniel Truong#0760","2019-09-30 08:46:52Z","@sencho In terms of wording, I would avoid using the phrase ""Be able to"" and use more action verbs. If you also find that in the future you are running out of space, I'd recommend getting rid of the descriptions about what the company or institution you've worked for does since I feel that it's not really necessary. But for now, I'd say to fix the spacing so that there's more space between the bolded title and the description so that it's more readable. In terms of content, I'd also add the classes you are planning to take under education (i like that you just put 4.0 btw lmaoo). Also I'd get rid of the line that says ""I create beautiful ..."". But yeah for the most part the content is good! Just a couple of minor tweeks should help it alot","","‚úä (2)"

For Contact info
- Include actual usernames for LinkedIn and GitHub, not just links. Offline, they won't be able to click on the links and online, ATS won't pull it out. Also some people might not realize it's clickable

For Education
- I would remove ""2nd year undergrad with junior standing"" Just expected graduation date is good enough
- Currently taking and relevant courses taken can be combined into one ""Relevant Courses"" section

For Experience
- Overall good descriptions for Google CSSI. Perhaps bold a few less words though, it's a bit distracting rather than emphasizing

For Technical Projects
- The link for B/lend isn't going to be available for most recruiters, it might help more if you take a shortened URL and place it on the side.
- Overall projects and descriptions are good!

For right column
- I personally recommend a single column format because it's easier to read for recruiters and it passes through ATS more. However, it's up to you because I do know two columns look nicer so you can take the risk.

Everything else looks good! Solid resume so far!","",""

"117543813563547648","LittlestAnt#3124","2019-10-04 23:51:59Z","@xyzmonk101 Overall really solid resume!

- For experience, As nibnalin said, change written to wrote. Besides that, your descriptions are solid. Perhaps include a bit more technologies in them. For example, did you use EagleCAD, Altrium to make PCBs or what languages did you use to write your scripts in line 3 (Python, Bash etc, i'm guessing implied BASH bc line 2)

- For education, I would remove relevant coursework until you take more impactful classes. Right now, saying you've only taken Java I hurts more than it helps. It shows the recruiter you aren't in your upper div classes yet and you're gonna want to hide that.

- For projects, and experience too, I would avoid repeating developed and created on repeat. Seek other words that really describe your impact. Words like collaborated in a team, or designed to show that you not only created it but you put effort into laying out how it SHOULD be built add quite a lot!

- Besides that, this is really impressive especially given the fact that you're a first year. As long as you keep it up as you add more experience, you'll be fine!","",""

Idk what else to say, I modeled my resume largely off of yours and you got into Google and Amazon LOL

"117543813563547648","LittlestAnt#3124","2019-10-05 00:00:09Z","-----
@British Yeri 
- For education, remove your intro classes. Only put the classes that matter the most for the career you're looking at. Overtime, as you gain more experience, you can remove more and more coursework since coursework is generally seen as just resume filler.

- For experience, add more info about SPIS! I'm not quite sure what the program entails but I recommend focusing more on what you built because it, in turn, showcases what you learned. For example, what technologies did you use to make your letter recognition program. What programming language? Scikit learn, tensorflow? You can include these!

- Do not separate technical projects and academic projects. Just put them together. Also, don't focus on what the project is, focus on what you did for the project instead. What technologies did you use? What languages? How much time did you build it in? How many people did you work on it with? How efficient is it? Basically, aim to answer the question ""What did I do?"" vs ""What is the project?"".

- For skills, do not rank your skills! I know the Career Center advises to do this but it doesn't apply to tech. Don't rank your skills but just list them instead. The interviewer will be the best judge of your skills. If you put basic / proficient instead of advanced it could hurt you because you are saying you aren't super confident about your skills but if you put advanced and you end up not being as good as they expect in your interview, they would think you were lying. Just list your skills especially since each company has different standards.

- Overall, you're almost there. Get a few more projects on your resume and rewrite some descriptions. Trust me, your resume is A LOT better than mine was when I was a second year at this time so feel good about yourself but keep on revising it!","",""

Never call yourself a ""participant"" for example. It's such an underwhelming word which I assume doesn't do your justice for what you probably did in these projects. Call yourself a developer, or programmer, or something like that. Another place where I can point out is where you said ""guided team members in...."" in your carpool project. I think you should say something like ""consulted"" or ""lead"" which sounds a bit more professional and strong. I don't think your team members would ever even get to see your resume to get offended, nor do I think they would get offended if you claimed to help lead the team because I am sure they would want to say similar things when applying for jobs.","","üòç (1)"

"117543813563547648","LittlestAnt#3124","2019-10-30 07:31:54Z","Hi @Solaratoz!

First off, your title doesn't make it very clear that you're studying Computer Engineering and that you're Class of 2023 at UCSD. I would place both of those underneath UC San Diego.

Secondly, go for descriptions in the form of bullet points! 

Also increase your font size. Your goal is to make your resume as easy to read for your recruiter as possible! This will also help fill up some blank space. I think the general rule is minimum 10.5 font.

Your devpost and github images are kind of blurry. If you can, try to also color them so they're thematically the same as your other icons. It creates more consistency!

Once you change your descriptions to bullet points, feel free to send it again. I love that your current descriptions talk about what you did and what you accomplished! Include more numbers if you can and try to be more precise in your descriptions (what technologies did you use, how many people were on your team, etc)

Besides that, this is a really good resume for some one this early in college! Just continue building more projects (Looks like you finished one at SD Hacks) and continue working hard.","",""

- I would just remove year and major from the title all around and place it underneath your Education section instead

- Also, try to make your bullet points more descriptive now. ""Aux Audio Input"" doesn't tell me much about the project, and if anything it would confuse a recruiter. A good general rule of thumb is begin each bullet point with a verb (Developed, Designed, Engineered, etc) in order to talk about what actions you took to implement the project.

- I think your Auto Schedule bullet points are the best, aim to make the other projects formatted similarly to your Auto Schedule

Resume's coming together though!","",""

This is looking pretty solid so far! 

- Put college above high school! They prefer everything in chronological order from most to least recent. Same goes with experience

- Also, remove ""unpaid"" from your bullet point. Unpaid does nothing but hurt your resume, you don't need to tell them how much you're getting paid.

- Like I said with Quoc, I think you should split your descriptions up into bullet points. Also, include more bullet points as well! Go into further detail about your experience!

- In continuation of the above point, I would actually remove some activities and projects that you don't care as much about so that you have space to elaborate on your more significant experiences. Remember, it's not about the quantity of your experiences but about the quality so really showcase that!

- Awards look good!

- Skills look good, I would remove the word ""basic"" preceding Python and Javascript because that does nothing but hurt you

ALSO, we're the Association for Computing Machinery not OF (I used to get it mixed up a lot too and I think of sounds a lot better than for too)

I can't really say much about your essays, I think they're solid! Feel free to break the rules of a traditional essay though and try to showcase your personality as best you can! Google is a company that follows pretty much no rules and so don't worry too much about being super formal, or even serious, in your writing.","",""

Also looking solid!

- For college time, I would actually just change it to say Aug 2019 - Jun 2023 (Expected)

- For Foto Fitness, it's API not AIP

- I think you don't need to put school / tutorial facilitated or solo project for Go 4 Shop. It's implied that it's a solo project

- I would add more description about your projects if you can because they're going to be your key experiences that help you stand out since you don't have much work experience yet

- Solid awards category, I love how you mention the number of teams you competed against

- Leadership is looking good, for VEX I would say various competitive robotics events to emphasize that they're engineering competitions (even if implied in name). Also for Applications of Computer Science, describe your various activities.

- Skills is solid

Overall, resume is good. I would just add more details where you can!","",""

I recommend adding cursor: pointer to your buttons, it helps a lot with the experience

Besides that, it might be good to include technical challenges and as Kendall mentioned, any sort of statistics you can to make your websites / apps sound more impressive. Numbers such as 1000 visitors or 500 downloads always helps out a lot. Unfortunately, you might not have these numbers without setting up Google Analytics.

I would also remove your React project to the first project at the top because recruiters would be looking at your first projects first and you want to showcase the technology that you know.

It really only affected me initially when I didn't have any job history - there were a couple companies that turned me down on the basis of not being computer science.

It's pretty common for EE's to switch into software, some people for example:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos
Gusto Founder: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomerlondon/
Gusto Founder: https://www.linkedin.com/in/edawerd/
Shift Software Engineer: https://www.linkedin.com/in/chen-zhu-0908/
UCSD Alumni (One of my mentors): https://www.linkedin.com/in/willchenyh/
Random Google person I met, but I forgot her name lol

For most large companies (FAANG), they likely won't care too much about difference between EE and CS. Although, I've heard smaller companies might discriminate more because they don't want to risk as much resources on a candidate.

But that mostly only matters for the beginning, like @riku  said. After your first internship, your degree will matter less.

During interviews if they ask ""Tell me about yourself"", I do mention my degree and explain my path on why I chose software (Less than 10 secs).

The main disadvantage has been not knowing things that CS students are supposed to know by the time they graduate. For example:
- Google Interview asked a Dynamic Programming question and I never learned it, so I failed that one
- Atlassian Interview asked a multithreading question with locks, and I scraped by using random stuff I read before
- During an internship, they talked about OS concepts which I didn't understand, so I had to look it up

For most of these though, I just needed to do some self-learning to get past it","",""

From Simon's screenshot, it's really hard to actually know where I should look if I only have 6 seconds to review your resume. Ideally, you want the recruiter's eyes to be naturally drawn to the most important parts (or have a clear pathway to it), but in this case it takes a second or two to even realize the layout of your resume and figure out what one should focus on.

Building on that (and this is highly subjective), you can take advantage of bolding contrast to really focus on the details that matter most in the 6 second window you'll have - it's a handful to read your full title @ company, but if I see <big company> on your resume that's already like an auto-pass to begin with - maybe try having only those bolded?","",""
