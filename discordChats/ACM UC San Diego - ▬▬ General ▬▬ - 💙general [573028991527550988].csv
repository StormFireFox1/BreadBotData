** Carne Asada Fries**
*Ok, these aren't Mexican but San Diego invented them and no one makes them better than we do. If you had to have a single meal in San Diego, it NEEDS to be fries.*

1. Lolita's - They claimed to have invented them, and I don't think anyone makes them better than they do. They have smaller portion sizes than most places and they admittedly aren't as good as they were just a few years ago bc of price cuts but I still haven't found a better place.

2. Vallarta's - UCSD classic, but I would only go here if it's like 2am and you're hungry and tired. Bonus points if you're drunk

3. Any place that ends with -berto","",""
"117543813563547648","LittlestAnt#3124","2019-10-25 02:52:57Z","**Tacos**
1. Tacos El Gordo - Best tacos all around, just get the Adobada tacos. UCSD students are obsessed with these tacos but so are the locals. Just get like ten of them

2. Taco Stand - Close to campus but overhyped imo. I think their carne asada tacos are pretty good though and definitely get a few churros.

3. Oscar's Fish Tacos - Good fish tacos if you need to be close to school

4. Mariscos German - If you can get down to Chula Vista, get these fish tacos. They're ridiculously good but also it's a food truck in the sketchy parking lot of a liquor store

5. TJ Oyster Bar - Also better than Oscar's. Go here if you don't want to be outside in a sketchy parking lot

6. Puesto - Go here if you want something fancy

7. SALUD - This is a really interesting taco shop located in Barrio Logan. There's a lot of good Mexican food options in this area in general that I haven't tried yet but I have a feeling this neighborhood is the gem for Mexican food in SD. It also has gorgeous murals so you could spend a lot of time walking around Chicano Park

** Burritos **
1. Lucha Libre - A touristy California burrito place that reddit hates but I like it a lot and Professor Niema who's a San Diego local said it's also the best burrito place so maybe reddit is just dumb","",""

I have some real good advice for working at home. I've been working on a remote job for at least 6 months now, and I could give you at least 5 things you can do to maintain productivity at home:

1. Always make sure to separate your life in rooms as much as possible. I know a few friends who make their bedroom their ""all-room""; the room where they sleep, eat, work, etc. This essentially causes your brain to lose the notion of environmental contexts that it generally uses in order to activate certain habits and patterns that you are used to. While it was very difficult for me, for a while I worked exclusively from the couch of my living room, since working in my bedroom generally caused me to slack off and do nothing. Make sure to keep a room for work, a room for chilling, a room for gaming, a roomf or sleeping; you'll get in the mood of doing that thing if you go in that room, over time.

2. Always block off your time using Google Calendar, even if you are at home. Create not only a consistent sleep schedule, but a good schedule for all your work as well. While this might seem like too much, it's good to have your devices warn of any impending time blocks you may have put into place earlier, in order to pull you from any activity that might've distracted you to the thing you were supposed to do at the time.","",""
"184400560634593281","Storm_FireFox1#0001","2020-04-05 03:47:45Z","3. If you used to exercise before ending up in self-isolation, exercise in your home office, if space offers. I have a decent body-weight workout that keeps me floating until the whole quarantine thing blows over. While it's not optimal, it keeps me moving and at least I don't become too much of a vegetable at home.

4. Separate your work life and chill life. Try to create profiles on your phone to change notifications you receive during certain times of the day. I make sure I receive no e-mail notifications (or from other work-related channels) after my work hours (7 PM is when I ""clock out"" of my job). Slack makes this really easy, too. In addition, also make sure you block off at least _some_ time for gaming and chilling. It's all too easy to only schedule your work time, but chill time is important, too.

5. Lastly, make sure to spruce up your desk! A lot of people keep clutter on their desks (or desktops) that makes it unappealing to stay there). I only keep the bare minimum on my desk, and all of it has a use for my work. I have my monitors, keyboard, iPad (for paper), phone and tickler file for any paper I need to scan. That's it. Don't keep old papers on your desk or anything like that. Also, get plants and nice decorations for your desk to make it your own!","",""

If you really want you can just do 50/50 cs math classes, and i would say 70% of upper div math you do take is relevant to cs i.e (math 154: graph theory, math 187a: intro to cryptography) however if you are cs and u wanna switch to math make sure you do your priority in cs flasses first (that‚Äôs what im doing)","",""

My parents were the under impression non-cs majors can't get careers or graduate school and so that's why i was originally going to go to UC Davis, the only school that offered me Computer Science. UC SD didn't offer me comp sci and so I was undeclared. But actually, 1 week before decisions, I did a bit more research and found out Cog sci at UCSD is actually quite famous (has fricken don norman although i think he's retiring now üò¶ ) and is actually a great route to grad school.  I personally wanted to do more AI oriented stuff (and I'm slowly getting there through self-learning and a shit ton of coding lmao, also taking a really good seminar by gary cottrell CSE 87 on neural networks rn), so i figured maybe Cog sci ML wouldn't be so bad. Coupled with some actually p good faculty and a great cog sci department, my parents were a little bit more ok with it. another reason why my parents felt a bit ok was because I was able to show results regardless of my major. I can still code and do programming related stuff and get internships, pass interviews, the major is just a label. (I've been given interviews from some companies and one p big one despite being cogs). Another thing is I also plan on double majoring with math-cs or cs in addition to cog sci, which is great because I get exposure to two different fields and I personally have always been fascinated by this particular intersection and my parents know that. Another point is that the Comp sci degree here at UCSD, while still being the ""CS"" degree, actually isn't as well suited for machine learning research oriented people and stuff. Actual mathematics and work is taught more under the cog sci department according to the cog sci department.","","üëç (8)"

"400790942925324308","StoneT2000#2103","2020-04-16 06:18:15Z","I presume cogsci is not capped mostly because a lot of people in the cogs major actually want to transfer out and only do CS if they can, as a result it doesn't seem like it attracts that much interest. But seriously CogSci here is excellent. If you work hard, talk to profs, you will literally have access to the world's best cog sci researchers lmao.

Also most of the entry level internship positions require the knowledge of about one or two coding classes here (CSE 11 and 12), even then, i personally learned nothing useful from those classes and completely self studied on my own.

In my opinion, we have a great faculty that genuinely cares about the success of students and I've always felt supported (in most of my classes at least). I also think that you may find more opportunities to explore your major here at UCSD compared to a CSU since there are so many orgs and research opportunities. Most professors are working on some sort of research project, so if you get to know them well enough you could get the opportunity to work with them! On the other hand, there are huge class sizes here which definitely can be daunting if you're more comfortable with a small classroom. I also think **in my opinion** that it can be more challenging to interact with others here since a lot of people generally like to keep to themselves. There isn't really school pride here. Even so, you can definitely have a social life here but you might have to put in a bit more effort here than other schools. I've met a lot of amazing people through ACM and other orgs so as long as you put in the effort you'd be fine :)","",""

I would just say to stay and keep your options open like @wd said, if you still want to switch to cs all of the screening courses are required in the math cs degree audit (with exception to cse 20 and cse 21) but even then you can substitute those classes for math ones.

You never really went steady, but you'd run into her from time to  
time while knocking around in disreputable joints, usually late at  
night, every several months or so.  She looked so hot, so sleek, so  
sexy, so expressive, so exotic.  You'd end up back at her place and  
the night would just...  take off.  A complete blur of hot, sweaty,  
feverish, delirious, fumbling passion.  You'd do things to each  
other...  you'd do things to her, she'd do things to you...  things  
that you're not even sure have names, that you're pretty sure are  
illegal almost anywhere.  Even her kinks have kinks --- and after one  
of these nights, you'd realize that you yourself had a lot more kinks  
than you.  And it wasn't just physical, it was --- cerebral.   
Ethereal.  Transcendent.  But it would all whiz by in a blur, and by  
morning you'd find yourself lightheaded, a bit confused, and  
stumbling homeward to your regular gal.","",""

think ""I could be doing so much bigger and better stuff with

keep telling yourself that.

Months would go by.  Late some night you'd find yourself out,  
disreputable places again.  Maybe that hacker bar, LtU.  Somebody'd  
slip you an URL for some renegade paper, you know, one of *those*

passion, she's going to say to you:  ""All these times, and you don't  
understand me at all!  You know, you're going to have to get serious,  
mister!  I've got needs, too.  You're going to have to get serious  
about my monads, or that's the last time you're going to play with  
them!  Got it?""

...and then, you've got to make The Choice.


Chances are, you're going to go back to your regular gal.  Haskell's  
just too much for any one man, probably.  She leaves a trail of  
broken, brainy, embittered PhDs and former programmers behind her.   
She ruins you for the RealWorld.  You can ride a while, but you  
probably can't go the distance with her.  Go back to your regular gal  
and try not to think too much about what you've seen.  Done.  Felt.   
Thought.

Maybe you can salvage a little happiness;  but it'll be hard.  After  
all...  you've tasted Haskell.

She's not like anything else.","","üëç (2)"

The PSU you have listed is ""B tier"" which is fine enough, I guess. You certainly could do worse. The one thing you may want to look out for is that this is not a modular PSU (or even a semi-modular PSU). A modular or semi-modular PSU will have power pin ports on the PSU instead of a bundle of cables hanging out of it, allowing you to choose only the cables you need so that you don't have extra cables just flopping around in your case. Semi-modular PSUs come with the most essential cables for your CPU and motherboard attached while the other cables are modular and removable, while fully modular PSUs have all cables removable if necessary.","",""

@sw4nky Part of the issue is the VRMs which handle power delivery to the CPU, especially if you have a higher tier CPU you can push it more overclocking wise. Also, things like port selection, PCIe slots, support for WiFi and Bluetooth (if that's something you're looking for). To be honest, most people (on AMD systems at least) can get by with a good B450 motherboard like the Tomahawk Max, but if you're looking to splurge a bit for a better board, X570 gets you more features, more SATA ports, better PCIe lane expansion, etc.

Honestly motherboards kind of become irrelevant above the $200 mark imo. I wouldn't spend more than that especially with COVID prices the way they are right now. The $500-600 motherboards? That's a waste unless you're looking for a VERY specific feature (for example, ITX support for small form factor builds, Thunderbolt 3 support on an AMD system, good IOMMU groupings for virtualization and PCIe device passthrough, etc.)","",""

A320 comes with a LOT of restrictions that just aren't worth it.","",""

You might not be able to get a massive boost out of it (at least not these days, CPUs tend to overclock less now simply because stock clocks are higher) but hey its free performance as long as your hardware can handle it","",""
