The color palette is good imo - for the color of the blue in the same text you can probably make it either a lighter blue (since smaller text looks darker), increase the size (may be inconsistent), or slightly darken the purpleish you use

i have a little other feedback if you don't mind just for readability: 
- you may want to put health and care on the same line so one doesn't have to think about what they mean separated
- make ""class size IS limited to"" ‚Üí ""limited to"" since if you're going to use ""is"" you'd need to use ""the"" at the beginning (i think)
- maybe change""reservers your spot"" ‚Üí ""to reserve a spot"" because ""your"" implies they already have a spot (? i'm not sure you can choose what you think). on the same bullet be sure to not have only one word on the next line. this is called a ""widow"" line","","üò≤ (1)"
