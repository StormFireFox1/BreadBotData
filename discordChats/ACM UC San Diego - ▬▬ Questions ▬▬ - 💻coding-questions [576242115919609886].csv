Two guys recently bought a plantation, of size **N** x **N** meters. After a bit of a complex analysis, they calculated the productivity of each 1x1 meter tile of the plantation (i.e. the amount of tobacco you get a day by planting tobacco in that tile).
To increase their productivity, they decided to analyse only certain square parts from the whole plantation. They want to answer `M` questions of the following format:
""Which is the highest productivity 1x1 tile from a sub-square of the plantation with its top-left corner at row `i` and column `j` and of side length `k`. Write a C/C++ program to solve this.

**Format of input file:** first two numbers are the `N` and `M` constants mentioned above. Then, `N` x `N` numbers representing the productivity of each tile of the plantation, then `M` rows of the format ""`i` `j` `k`""

**Format of output file:** N lines, with just the answer (i.e. the productivity of the tile mentioned in the question)

** Restrictions:** 1 <= N <= 500, 1 <= M <= 75.000, productivity of each tile is an `long`, columns and lines will be 1-indexed from the input file, and you are guaranteed **all queries will be in the `N` x `N` grid**

**Example**

Input file:
```

@hexalellogram I would also try to change little bits here and there (like changing < to <=) hoping it would work and it would also take me a lot of time to find the actual solution even though I had the right idea from the very beginning. I realized that it was due to bad planning that it would take such a long time making all those small changes to make it work. If you take your time to plan with pen and paper all the edge cases and every small detail, you will actually save yourself a lot of time. Whenever I was setting 25 min to solve a problem, I would not let myself to write a single line of code the first 15 minutes until I had planned everything thoroughly.","","👍 (2)"

This quarter, I have been focusing on doing leetcode problems and making sure I understand why a certain algorithm pattern and data structure was used after completing each question.

My main problem right now is that it’s hard for me to tell if I’m improving or not and I’m still struggling with leetcode medium problems. I’m thinking about going through sections of the “Competitive Programmer’s Handbook” to help me understand algorithm patterns better but please let me know if there are additional resources I should look into!","",""
"90669319024836608","for loop#9853","2020-05-03 19:01:02Z","@tritons99 for technical interviews specifically I highly recommend sticking to a curated list on leetcode. https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU . I highly recommend going through this curated list for studying.  Also some other general tips, just make sure that you stay diligent with how much you study day.  Honestly 30 minutes a day is sufficient if you try to study every day.  As for patterns although pattern matching is good i think its better to develop those critical thinking and problem solving skills used to approach problems rather than trying to pattern match. However if there is a problem you encounter where you are completely lost and only know the bruteforce implementation I highly recommend checking out a youtube video on the leetcode problem or a highly related discussion link.","","👍 (1)"

ou are given a list of airports (three-letter codes like 'JFK'), a list of routes (one-way flights from one airport to another like ['JFK', 'SFO']), and a starting airport.

Write a function that returns the minimum number of airport connections (one-way flights) that need to be added in order for someone to be able to reach any airport in the list, starting at the starting airport.

Note that the connections don't have to be direct; it's okay if an airport can only be reached from the starting airport by stopping at other airports first.

"184400560634593281","Storm_FireFox1#0001","2020-05-22 21:59:43Z","@Rinsworth, alright so:

When you simulate a VM in the traditional sense (VMWare, VirtualBox), you're essentially hijacking a part of the CPU to run system calls that an operating system would be. Therefore, it lets you run two OS'es at once (with some other sandboxing magic, but we're not here to talk about that).

Generally, however, you don't need to run the whole OS to virtualize a process, right? You just want the bare minimum to get your app running. Additionally, what's the point of, say, running a Linux VM on Linux? All the system calls are there to begin with!

This is where Docker comes in; it essentially virtualizes a pseudo-operating system that is very closely tied to the currently running one, which allows for a bunch of that extra overhead VM's use to be abstracted under a common machine.","",""
"184400560634593281","Storm_FireFox1#0001","2020-05-22 22:06:46Z","Dockerfiles aren't exactly scripts, they're more like build instructions. Whenever you run a line in a Dockerfile, Docker essentially creates ""intermediate packages"" that reflect the various changes you ran on a base image. Say you start with an Ubuntu base container (essentially an image of an Ubuntu installation), you do:

```docker
FROM ubuntu
```

Therefore, this makes Docker start with an already built container that is basically base Ubuntu. Afterwards, if you want to, say, virtualize a Node application under a Docker container, you start running commands that build together everything Node needs:

```docker
RUN apt-get install -y software-properties-common python
RUN add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
RUN echo ""deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise universe"" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y nodejs
```

These essentially run additional commands on top of the original container, which allow you to create your own. Afterwards, you can add files from your host machine to the Docker container. Then you can run that script and get your container, which will run a Node server separately from every process on your computer!
```docker
ADD someServer.js /var/www

CMD [""/usr/bin/node"", ""/var/www/someServer.js""]
```","",""

Basically you are given an array of objects where each value in the array corresponds to that certain weight and the index is that object. so for example an array of w = [1,2,3] is basically object 0: weight = 1/6, object 1: weight = 2/6, object 2: weight = 3/6. So if i envsioned this problem as if i were to reach my hand into a bag and pick a random object, where will my hand land? And note that for this example your hand is more likely to land on objects with a higher weight. There is a 50% chance I will land my hand on object 2 since the weight is 3 , total weight is 3/6 so P(object2) = 50%","",""
