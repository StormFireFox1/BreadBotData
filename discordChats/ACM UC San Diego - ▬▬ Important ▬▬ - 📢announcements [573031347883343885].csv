Hey y’all! I just wanted to say thank you so much for coming out tonight. I’m really sorry for anyone who wasn’t able to make it into the room or didn’t feel full from the food. I really didn’t expect this level of turnout; never in my three years at UCSD have I seen a line stretch from PC East to Library Walk.

I want to reemphasize how grateful I am for you all. When we started this chapter last March, we didn’t know what to expect. We grew our team by four times its original size and we each poured our heart and soul into nurturing our baby. Countless hours of sleep lost (some of our board were even at a hackathon all night last night) and thousands of lines of code written. You all showing up today made every single moment worth it. I’m so happy to see that this is no longer just my org, nor is it just my team’s org, but that it’s also YOUR org. I hope every single person gains something from this, whether it’s knowledge of a new language, a summer internship, or lifelong friendships.

I’m excited to see where this year takes us all and I can’t wait to continue getting to know each and every single one of you. Hope to see you all throughout this week!","","👌 (17),❤ (22),🇦 (13),🇨 (13),🇲 (13),👍 (4),peepoNoU (5),peepoT (5),peepoY (4),amel_heart (4),peepoM (4),peepoC (4),cursecat (5),FeelsLoveMan (5),peepoHappyLove (5),peepoA (4),acm (6)"

ALSO, I MADE A MISTAKE ON THE COFFEE / SWEETS ORDER FOR LATER THIS AFTERNOON.

Like @Jeff said, if you can provide rides that would be splendid! 

❓ WHAT SHOULD I BRING? 
Bring yourself and an openness to meet new people! A water bottle, sunscreen, towel, jacket for when it gets dark, and beach sandals will also be good! Food will be provided

📍 WHERE DO I GO?
We've changed the location to Mission Bay Park - Crown Point South. Cross streets: Crown Point Drive and Ingraham Street. 

🚀 HOW DO I GET THERE?
A few ways! 

1. At 4:30 PM, take the 150 line bus toward Old Town and wait for us there 🚌
It's the station on the side closest to Gilman Transit Center (near Center Hall). You can also Map it and should get directions. Someone from ACM will be holding the 🔷 blue diamond 🔷 and there to help you use the bus system if you haven't already. When you get to Old Town, we'll pick you up and take you to Mission Bay. If you miss it, take the next one and we'll be transporting between 4-5 PM

If you haven't already, download the ""COMPASS CLOUD"" app. It has your bus tickets in it 

2. Grab a few friends and split an Uber 🚗 
It should be around $15 - $20 for a normal one way

3. Join us right NOW! 🌊 
I'm sitting here at the fire pit programming and looking for company. We can drive you down to Mission Bay if you come now and hang out until the event starts! Just message me or @LittlestAnt  

💙 We are so excited to meet you tonight! Do not hesitate to contact me, @LittlestAnt, @Snu, or @Jeff  if you have any questions!","",""

With winter break coming to a close it’s time for things to start revving up again so I have a few announcements to make regarding the future of the ACM Discord, a future that YOU will be able to shape.

First of all, we have been planning and brainstorming some Discord events that will promote a more social online space for all of y’all as well as just being a place where everyone can have fun. There will also most likely be check-in codes so that y’all can get some points for participating! As of now, some ideas that we have in mind are League tournaments (TFT, 5v5, etc.), trivia games, and/or podcasts - but nothing is set in stone. We would love for your ideas, suggestions, and feedback so we have made a form for this which can be found at:
http://acmurl.com/discordevents

We have also made a Discord feedback form where y’all can give us feedback on our Discord server. This includes suggestions, ideas, or just feedback on how things are running! The form can be found here: 
http://acmurl.com/feedback 
and will also be posted in the #💁info   channel for easy accessibility in the future. Also feel free to just ping me or DM me if you have feedback as well!

Enjoy the rest of your break and try to fill out the events form ASAP so that we can start planning and hosting Discord events soon!","","👾 (5),🤩 (7),c_sixth (1)"

Discord recently introduced logging in via QR code, which is pretty handy when the desktop version randomly decides to log you out.

However, as you may have noticed, a small exploit exists, so I'll say this upfront:
NEVER and I mean NEVER scan a QR code for Discord-related gifts or prizes, including Nitro giveaways, through the Discord mobile app, EVER. You are NOT redeeming the ""prize"", you're giving someone FULL access to your account, regardless of 2FA. Until Discord adds a notice to their app, you'll have to be extremely cautious about this.

PSA if you moderate a server: If you see someone posting a QR code in your server and claiming it gives Nitro, DELETE IT.

Be sure to spread the word to everyone you know. This is a serious flaw with Discord's login system, and there's probably a lot of people losing accounts to this scam.

AKA If you can't claim gifts via clicking, don't claim them.

With that being said, I think it’s more important to keep ACM a safe space than it is to keep ACM an open space. It shatters my heart to hear that there’s been reports of stalking by ACM members from ACM members. People are being followed to their classes and to their meetings and it’s unacceptable. Stalking and harassment not only violate ACM UC San Diego’s Constitution, but they violate the international ACM Code of Conduct as well. We refuse to tolerate any of this behavior in our organization. If we hear any reports of this behavior, we will not hesitate to ban you from all ACM activities including events, meetings, and online media.

If at any time you feel uncomfortable in ACM, please feel free to fill out our anonymous feedback form - https://acmurl.com/report .
You’re also free to message me personally and I will take care of it for you. It is my absolute number one priority, not just within this org but with life as a whole, that every member of our ACM family always feels safe, welcome, and comfortable. I will do everything I can to make sure you feel safe (and trust me I have a lot of contacts and there’s a lot I can do).

I’m sorry you all had to read this and I hope we’re able to ensure that you feel protected in our community.","","acm_white (29)"

As I’m sure you all are well aware by now, the situation with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is evolving daily across the United States. To date, there have been no confirmed cases of the virus on the UC San Diego campus, but several large-scale events were recently canceled in response to public concerns. (For the most up-to-date news regarding the UCSD community, please regularly check your email and keep an eye on https://coronavirus.ucsd.edu/). 

We want to assure you that we will still be engaging with the ACM community with these concerns in mind throughout the Spring quarter. We will continue to host smaller events on campus for those who will be at UCSD, but will be making them accessible virtually to include those who wish to maintain social distance. Your health and well-being is our top priority, and as such will be taking the following steps regarding upcoming events for ACM.","",""

Since our kickoffs are typically our largest event each quarter, we want to make this event equally accessible for any who wish to attend. This decision was made in line with UCSD Guidelines and Policies, which discourage events with an expected attendance of over 100 people.
 
**Regular on-campus events**: Events with an expected attendance of under 100 people will still occur on campus. We will have sanitation stations at each event, and any food available will be pre-packaged to prevent spreading of disease. Keep in mind that if you ever feel sick or are showing symptoms of illness, please stay home and tune in virtually.  

**Live streaming**: We will be making sure to live stream all events next quarter. Our goal is to provide quality content and workshops to all, and we recognize that many of you will not be here physically next quarter. Live streams will be available to watch after the event has ended, although the check-in code will have expired. 

**More online events**: ACM is a community, and we primarily interact through our socials. However, to ensure that we prevent the spread of COVID-19, we will be promoting more Discord Community events (tune in online @ acmurl.com/discord!).","","acm (11)"

Thanks to popular requests, BreadBot now has the ability to count the number of times a command is run!

Every time you all run a valid command by BreadBot, it will be saved and kept for a later date. Any command will work, including
those that fail (`/acmurl` life).

I will release the counts of each command in beautiful graph (blog post?) form sometime after Finals Week of Spring Quarter!

ACM AI is preparing to host our first prototype AI competition. It's a really interesting competition design that's easy to play (you can write an AI in less than 20 lines of code), but hard to master (we will release game details later).

Feel free to ask questions, ask for help, and/or discuss strategies in the #competitions channel! We want to also reiterate some important rules for the competition

1. We Treat each other with respect. ACM is an all inclusive community. We accept and welcome people of all backgrounds and skill levels. Harassment, hate speech, and verbal abuse are STRICTLY prohibited and will result in an immediate ban from the competition.

2. Any hacks, while encouraged to be sought out, must not actually be performed. We ask that you demonstrate it is possible, but to not actually perform said hack and you send the demonstration and code to us at ai@acmucsd.org. Moreover, you may not submit bots that perform the hack on the competition, we do not condone malicious activity. This includes but is not limited to, shutting down our servers, removing our files, reading other competitor's code etc.

3. You are not allowed to open source your bot code until the conclusion of the competition as will be stated in this document and the website ai.acmucsd.com. You may talk about it with other competitors but we ask for the integrity of the competition that you don't share it.

4. Have fun!","","acm (8),🇦 (4),🇮 (4),🤖 (2)"
