@hexalellogram  Apparently if you don’t receive any financial aid, no matter how close you were to the cutoff, you get nothing, nada, zilch.  I don’t think it’s unreasonable, as they’re prioritizing the students who need it most, but it’s frustrating nonetheless.","",""

@AlexL1220 Can you P/NP the class instead, if your major allows it (I assume that since it's a math class, it's a major requirement)? At least it won't negatively affect your GPA. You said that your grade might be around a low 90 so passing the class shouldn't be a problem.","",""

For the past 3 quarters of my college career various personal issues and my own carelessness have caused me to do not so well academically (still above a 3.0 gpa cumulative). However, I have since realized my own failings and am working as hard as I can this quarter and on to raise my gpa. My internship this summer was also conveniently cancelled, which can be a positive thing since I will have more time to read more into research which I want to get into next year. Nevertheless, I am afraid of how the lack of professional experience I will gain this summer and my mediocre gpa for my first 2 years will affect my chances of getting into a good grad school after my senior year. I have calculated that if I get a 3.8 gpa for the last 2 years of college I will be able to graduate with an A- average, but idk if it will be too late for grad apps. If it is indeed too late, I am planning to do a 5th year at ucsd to further raise my gpa. However, due to covid-19 my parents have lost their source of income since they will not be able to collect rent, and idk how much longer they will be able to fund my college education.
Again sorry for this long rant but these are the things I have been struggling with right now.","",""

I don't know what you want from all of ACM's members, every piece of advice is followed up with an argument or a piece of negativity.

In any case, if you want the best mentors, you should be open and willing to listen to people. No one wants to mentor a pessimist. And the sad fact is, I'm afraid the majority of ACM members aren't suited to be your mentor either. Most of us don't worship dollar bills here.","","👆 (9),care (11),kirbow (9)"

I'd like to firstly thank you for sending out a statement to all of us in -CLASS X-, while many of us are anxious and waiting for responses on the state of our grades and finals, it is re-assuring that we have these needy announcements.

After reading the recent statement on the stance of the -CLASS X- final, I wanted to bring up some unintended consequences that may arise when students opt in for an incomplete grade.

1. With the shift to P/NP being extended to week 11, it unequally favors students who can take the final during week 11. So, although a student is unable to study for the final, they may take the final unprepared because they have the option of P/NP-ing the class. This reduces the mastery of the subject and does not create an equal playing field.

2. If students are doing very poorly in a class, the circumstances can be amplified during the Summer. For many students expecting to work 40+ hours during the pandemic, it is less feasible to shift studying for an exam in the summer versus right now.
