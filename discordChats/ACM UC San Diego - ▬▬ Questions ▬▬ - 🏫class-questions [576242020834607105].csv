It is not a waste of time since you will be learning things; however, if you are able to use your time more wisely, it would be more effective to put it into CS. ENG 10 caters to engineering overall. So if you want to learn a little python, CAD, and soldering (EE) then it is good exposure. You will also have a professor at your resource. However, it may be more interesting and effective to use the time to learn Python on your own and more in depth than ENG 10 would teach.

Basically, you need to complete both of these lower div series before you take CSE 100, which blocks you from taking most upper divs

CSE 11 -> CSE 12 ./ 15L -> CSE 30
CSE 20 -> CSE 21

Because of this, taking CSE 20 doesn't really get you ahead timewise, just because you end up still having to complete CSE 11 / 12 / 30 before you can take 100. That being said, taking it at CC does give you the advantage of being able to take an additional GE in lieu of CSE 20, but if taking it in cc costs you extra money, i would just take it at ucsd","","üëç (1)"

The groups in the Spring 2020 CSE 125 class will be presenting and demoing their projects on Friday, June 5, from 4-5:30pm...streaming live online!  We would like to invite everyone to join us to watch the live demos.The following page will have the streaming link when it's
created next week:

  https://cse125.ucsd.edu/2020/groups.html

The goal of CSE 125 is for the students to experience the design and implementation of a large, complex, distributed software system with real-time constraints, and do it in large groups. For motivation, the project assignment was to build a distributed, real-time, 3D, multiplayer game...in 10 weeks...and this quarter, remotely (!).

This course is also an opportunity for the students to take everything that they have learned in their classes over the years and apply it to one project in one quarter.  As you'll see, they have learned a tremendous amount: the projects are amazing. For a preview, see the group web pages:

  https://cse125.ucsd.edu/2020/groups.html

Each group web page has a project design, project specification, weekly status reports, screenshots, etc. -- together, these documents chart the progress of the groups and the evolution of their projects throughout the quarter.

At the demos we will start with a brief introduction to the course, and then each of the groups will present and demo their project.

We hope you can join us!

Hi Christopher,

Thanks so much for reaching out! I'll be co-teaching with another instructor, and we're currently planning to coordinate many aspects of the course.

Best wishes,
