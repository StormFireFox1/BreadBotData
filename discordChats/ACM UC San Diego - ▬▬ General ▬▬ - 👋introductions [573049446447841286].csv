I'm an international student and a Computer Science major and this is my 7th year at UC San Diego! Yup, I'm what's referred to as a resident. I'm from Muir College, I have the 2012 light blue T-shirt. I'm a late bloomer; I switched to CS from Psychology my Junior year! I also took a 1 year leave of absence. It's been a bumpy road, but better late than never. If you would like advice on how NOT to fail, come to me, I know a lot about failure and getting back on track; there is no shame in failing as long as you learn from your mistakes. I speak Arabic, and I'm a beginner at Japanese. I enjoy learning about different languages and cultures. I also enjoy learning about people, so I'm excited to make friends at ACM before I graduate this year (keeps fingers crossed). I love karaoke and singing, and I watch Netflix on my free time. I used to play LoL a few years back, but the community was so toxic and the game addicting so I stopped playing, but let me know if you would like to play, and I'll consider -maybe- playing with you haha. I would like to get better at guitar, and would like to learn a self defense martial art. Excited to be more involved in an organization, and make more friends. Hope you all have a wonderful quarter and year 🙂","","💙 (5),❤ (4)"
